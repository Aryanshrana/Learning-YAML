# Learning-YAML

OLD definition of YAML is yet another markup language.
YAML = YAML ain't markup Language(new definition)

YAML is a data serialization language used to represent data in code.
WHAT IS SERIALIZATION? 
  Serialization is process to cenvert the objects(data+code) into streams of bytes or streams of storage that can be stores in databases,yaml or memory.
  Deserialization is reverse process of it.
  
Or we can say that:

  Converting object to file is serialization and convserting file(human readablr format) to object is deserialization.
